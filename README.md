# Week E^0 2018 Website


This is the repository of the Week E^0 2018 website. This website provides information Week E^0 and E-Retreat for incoming students and potential volunteers. The website uses the static website generator [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), which takes advantage of React to render the various webpage components.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing. See deployment for notes on how to deploy to a live machine.
