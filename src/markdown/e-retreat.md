# E-Retreat: a fun-dense weekend with your new pals

At the end of two weeks of fun on-campus, we go on retreat! Probably the best part of being a first year —seriously. 2-days-2-nights of students-only fun. Do what you want, or participate in organized events!

Come with an open mind and it’ll be the experience of a lifetime. Bond with new friends, hear stories from the older students (there as volunteers), and learn more about how to get involved. E^0 Retreat 2018 will be located at a huge summer camp with a beach for swimming!
