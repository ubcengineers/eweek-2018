# E-Retreat: a fun-dense weekend with your new pals

At the end of two weeks of fun on campus, we go on retreat! Probably the best part of being a first year — seriously. 2-days-2-nights of students-only fun. Take some time to hang out, as well as participate in organized events!

Come with an open mind and it’ll be the experience of a lifetime. Bond with new friends, hear stories from the older students (there as volunteers), and learn more about how to get involved. E-Retreat 2018 will be located on Gambier Island, at Camp Latona! Activities this year may include:
 * Ropes courses
 * True Engineer
 * Kayaking
 * Swimming
 * Board and Card Games
 * Bonfires
 * Gambier Island Murder Mystery
 * Tankings
 * Shameless Pride in Engineering
 * And of course, the traditional hike!

Want to come? Trust us, you want to come. Register [here, hyperlink]! Due to capacity of the camp, there are limited spots, so make sure to reserve your spot early!
