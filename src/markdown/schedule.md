# Schedule
## Week 1 Events
### Imagine Day BBQ
**Time**: Tuesday Sept. 4, 4:00 PM - 7:00 PM **Location**: EOSC Field

This week will start off with exactly what every student needs – free food!  Come swing by the Earth and Ocean field and grab a burger (veggie options too) on us.  Red Sales will be out selling the historic “Reds” at a discounted price.  “Reds” are the popular engineering-only jackets you will see many upper-years wearing with prides.  It is traditional to cover your Red in patches you can buy or earn from the EUS.  Come by and try on a jacket, grab a burg, play some ultimate frisbee, or you can check out our patches or official EUS cardigans. 

### Scavenger Hunt
**Time**: Tuesday Sept. 4, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM **Location**: Based in EOSC Field, but all of campus is free reign!

This event will follow the Imagine Day BBQ and start and finish out of the EOSC field. This event is a digital scavenger hunt using [name of software].  Groups of 3-5 will be given a list of items or locations to find around campus and will take photos of their group doing the item and submit them to [name of software].  Prizes will be given for funniest/best group photo.  This event is great to meet new people, find your way around campus, and get to know some historic landmarks at UBC.  If you don’t have a group or are wishing to meet new people, let us know and we can find you partners.  This event will operate on a rolling start.  Groups have two hours once started to submit all of their photos.

### Games Night with Profs
**Time**: Wednesday Sept. 5, 5:30 PM - 9:00 PM **Location**: Engineering Student Centre

Your professors (believe it or not) are people.  And they, too, enjoy playing games.  Many of the first-year professors as well as program directors and deans will be there, who are an awesome resource to get to know.  We will be hosting a variety of board and card games, and did we mention free food?  Grab some classic Week E0 burgers and other snack when you swing by the ESC to hang out with your peers, EUS volunteers, and some of the UBC Engineering Faculty as well! 

### True Engineer
**Time**: Thursday Sept. 6, 11:00 AM - 12:30 PM **Location**: Engineering Student Centre

A true engineer can fulfill any design requirements they’re given (no matter how goofy) with whatever materials they’re given (no matter how silly).  Switch out the free burgers for free pizza, and take part in a creative team-based design competition with some fun prizes!

### E-Retreat 101 - A guide to the best weekend ever
**Time**: Thursday Sept. 6, 4:00 PM - 5:00 PM **Location**: Engineering Student Centre

Want a chance to get some quality time with your fellow first years, explore west-coast beauty, and have one last wicked weekend before school ramps up?  Come to this info session and learn about E-Retreat: a trip out to Camp Latona on Gambier Island during the second weekend of school. Bond with new friends, hear stories from the older students (volunteers at E-Retreat), and learn more about how to get involved within Engineering.


### hEUStory & Godiva Band BBQ
**Time**: Thursday Sept. 6, 5:00 PM - 7:00 PM **Location**: Engineering Student Centre

Ever heard about strange occurrences happening around Vancouver, like Red Volkswagen Beetles showing up in confounding locations?  Students “burning” piles of books from the UBC libraries?  Certain special chairs from Parliament going missing?  Come listen to some incredible stories about UBC Engineers past, as well as those things mentioned above that obviously have no relation to them.  In the theme of UBC Engineering history, the well-loved Godiva Band will be performing!  If you are interested in joining, talk to any of the members.  They practice once a week and are always looking for more musicians.  As always, free food will be abound!

### Ultimate
**Time**: Friday Sept. 7, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM **Location**: Forestry Field

Get ready to start living the Vancouver lifestyle and join us for some Ultimate Frisbee!  Beginners and experts alike are welcome, and at the very least you can come down and enjoy the free BBQ!

### Back-to-School Party
**Time**: Friday Sept. 7, 7:00 PM - 12:00 AM **Location**: Forestry Field

Although not technically part of E^0, this is a welcome back party at the ESC for upper years, transfer students, and mature first years.  Guaranteed to be a ton of fun!

## Week 2 Events
### Engineering Clubs and Teams Day
**Time**: Tuesday Sept. 11, 11:00 AM - 1:00 PM **Location**: EDC Courtyard

One of the best Week E0 events that you can go to help make the most of your university experience! We definitely recommend showing up to this.

### E-Retreat Info Session
**Time**: Wednesday Sept. 12, 5:00 PM - 6:00 PM **Location**: Engineering Student Centre

This session is mandatory for anyone going on E-Retreat, so if you’ve signed up already or are thinking of going, make sure to come to this!

### PrE-Retreat BBQ
