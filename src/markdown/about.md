# Hello and welcome to E-Week: the best week of the year.

Welcome to a week of challenges, competition, and, of course, fun. Test your skills in mechanical design, dodgeball, trivia, and more. Watch your classmates prove they know more science than the sci-fi movies, create a model to dispense BEvERages, and race chariots down Main Mall. Are you ready?
