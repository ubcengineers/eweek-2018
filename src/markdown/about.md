# The best way to kickstart your first year at UBC.
Week E0 is the second best week of the year*. Excited for September? Just wait til you see what the EUS has in store for you. BBQs, movie nights, pancake breakfasts, and some crazy traditions to be a part of! It’s our grand opening bash, so start off your year right by hanging out with your fellow first years for the first week full of back-to-back activities. The second week will be a little less busy, especially since classes will be in full swing, but don’t miss the info session for E-Retreat or the chance to interact with UBC’s various engineering student teams and clubs. We hope to see you around!
